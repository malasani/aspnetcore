    For safety, do this for all converter types, even though most of them are preserved anyway due to being referenced
    statically. It's only JsonStringEnumConverter that currently isn't referenced statically.
    The following is a workaround for https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19086.
    The underlying issue is reported in the runtime repo at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/34449 -->
